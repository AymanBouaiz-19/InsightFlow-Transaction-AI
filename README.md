# 💼 InsightFlow – Transaction AI

🔎 A next-generation financial data analyzer powered by Python & AI.  
InsightFlow helps users understand, predict, and optimize their transaction flow using automated anomaly detection, smart categorization, and machine learning-driven forecasting.

> ⚠️ This project is under development. UI & cloud features are coming soon.

## 🚀 Why InsightFlow?

Managing transactions isn’t just about looking at numbers — it’s about finding **patterns**, spotting **anomalies**, and making **intelligent decisions**.  
InsightFlow empowers developers, analysts, and even individuals to take control of financial data using AI-powered tools, all built from scratch by an AI engineering student.

analyzer.categorize()                 # Auto-tag each transaction
analyzer.detect_anomalies()          # Find unusual financial patterns
analyzer.forecast()                  # Predict future spending trends
analyzer.generate_report("reports/july_summary.pdf")  # Export report
